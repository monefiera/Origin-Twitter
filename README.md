My Personal Twitter-mod Build for Colorful Lovers. based on [Piko](https://github.com/crimera/piko)<br>

## Note
- [kitadai31](https://github.com/kitadai31) [implemented a language conversion patch in Piko based on my previous method](https://github.com/crimera/piko/pull/430). Thank you so much!
- Also therealswak/Swakshan, co-Founder of Piko, [was positive about implementing the color patch into Piko](https://t.me/pikopatches/1/17092). So [I opened a issue](https://github.com/crimera/piko/issues/431) and shared what I've done for developers in this README.
- When the color patch is implemented in Piko, this repository will be completely finished its role(i.e., it will become a public archive and will no longer be updated).

## About this
Piko-Twitter Mod with 10 theme colors<br>

### Important Section
**Long Time No See😅 Origin Twitter is Back**<br>

As my personal life has stabilized and the login issues are being resolved, I am resuming updates.<br>
I have switched to using [monsivamon/twitter-apk](https://github.com/monsivamon/twitter-apk), which I consider to be the most stable option at the moment.<br>

<details>
<summary>Previous information (2025/02/20～2026/06/28)</summary>

**The new method is to get the apk from [crimera/twitter-apk](https://github.com/crimera/twitter-apk) repository and apply the patch script!**<br>

This means that users can no longer choose between Piko or Hachidori, but instead I can provide rapidly-updates with each release of crimera.<br>
Currently, I use the prebuilt apk from crimera, but in the future I'll improve it to download from [apkmirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/x-corp/twitter/), do AntiSplit process, and apply Piko, just like the original repository.<br>
</details>

(To piko Developers) Please let me know if there are any rights issues with this modification, ~~except for Elon~~<br>

## Changes from original crimera's apk
- You can choose your favorite from 10 colors themes<br>
・All signatures are the same, so colors can be easily changed by re-installing the app (since v10.80.1)<br>
・Origin Blue appears to have no significant change over the original, but minor color adjustments have been made<br>

## How to make colorful mod (for piko developers)
<details>
This may be a little confusing, but please use it as hints for a complete color patch implementation and Bring Back Twitter fix.<br>
This covers of piko's Bring Back Twitter patch partially.<br>
<br>
1: Replace “?dynamicColorGray1100” or “@color/gray_1100” in this files with “@color/twitter_blue”.<br>  
・res\layout\ocf_twitter_logo.xml<br>
・res\layout\channels_toolbar_main.xml<br>
・res\layout\login_toolbar_seamful_custom_view.xml<br>
・style name="Theme.LaunchScreen"'s [windowSplashScreenBackground] in res\values\styles.xml<br>
・[ic_launcher_background] in res\values\colors.xml<br>

2: Replace “#ff1d9bf0” or "#ff1da1f2" with “@color/twitter_blue” in this files.<br>
・res\drawable\all_links_nudge_title_icon.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_ellipses.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_map_pin.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_toast_survey_complete.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_toxicity.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_camera_shortcut.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_colorpicker_off.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_colorpicker.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_follow_tint.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_illustration_ocf_contacts.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_illustration_sparkle_off.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_location_blue_tint.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_medium_camera_live_stroke_tint.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_medium_camera_stroke_tint.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_medium_camera_video_stroke_tint.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_medium_photo_stroke_tint.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_medium_trashcan_stroke_tint.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ic_vector_search_shortcut.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ps__bg_hydra_label.xml<br>
・res\drawable\ps__ic_new_hydra_first_time_dialog_cancel.xml<br>
   
From here on down, styles and colors indicate the xml under the res\values.<br>
   
3: In styles.xml, change value of “coreColorBadgeVerified” for **<style name="TwitterBase.Dim" parent="@style/PaletteDim">**, **<style name="TwitterBase.LightsOut" parent="@style/PaletteLightsOut">** and **<style name="TwitterBase.Standard" parent="@style/PaletteStandard">** to @color/blue_500.<br>

4: In styles.xml, replace “abstractColorUnread” values of **<style name="PaletteDim" parent="@style/HorizonColorPaletteDark">**, **<style name="PaletteLightsOut" parent="@style/HorizonColorPaletteDark">** and **<style name="PaletteStandard" parent="@style/HorizonColorPaletteLight">** to @color/twitter_blue_opacity_50.<br>
And change the value of “abstractColorLink” in **<style name=“PaletteStandard” parent=“@style/HorizonColorPaletteLight”>** to @color/twitter_blue.<br>
   
At this point, the preparation is complete.<br>
   
5: In color.xml, change “badge_verified” value to “twitter_blue” to #ff (any color code).<br>
In addition, change “deep_transparent_twitter_blue”, “twitter_blue_opacity_30”, “twitter_blue_opacity_50”, and “twitter_blue_opacity_58”, paying attention to # and the first two characters.<br>

6: Find two -0xE26410 values in the smali file and replace them with the FF (color code) specified in color.xml.<br>
Needless to say, note that it is necessary to convert to smali value. The location of the two smali files with hidden color codes varies from version to version, but the last two letters of the file name are the same, like yxx.smali and rxx.smali.<br>

The following is a brief description of what is done in each section.<br>
<details>
At 1's login_toolbar_seamful_custom_view.xml defines the color of the bird when first logging into Twitter. This and other parts of this work complete elements that Bring Back Twitter has not been able to return to.<br>
At 2, the work is to change the parts (such as the camera icon on the tweet screen) whose colors do not change even if the procedures described in 3 and below are performed.<br>
At 3 and beginning of 5, replace work is being done to change the badge color back to blue. This is because the same color as the theme may be difficult to recognize.<br>
At 4, the color of notification column is treated to be linked to the theme. Also, only in the light theme, the link color is not @color/twitter_blue, so the color is reflected by replacing it.<br>

## Past Section(Documentation before 2025-02-20)
<details>
Currently (2024/12/14), it can be patched successfully within [Revanced Extended Builder](https://github.com/inotia00/rvx-builder).

Please patch it yourself to use [Revancify](https://github.com/decipher3114/Revancify).<br>
I don't recommend [Revanced Manager](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-manager) because it has an error when apk signing.<br>
Currently (2024/10/22), it can be patched successfully by using the latest dev version in [Revanced Extended Manager](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-manager).<br>

LSPatch※ may inject [Hachidori](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/com.twifucker.hachidori) with non-root devices(but not recommended).<br>
※At 1st, I had written [JingMatrix repository](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPatch), but after verification it was not possible, so I'm taking it down.<br>
I'm currently looking for a patchable LSPatch.<br>
